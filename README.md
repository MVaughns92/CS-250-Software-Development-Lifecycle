   - How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpresting user needs typically begins with anaylizing the system. Either by asking the team for feedback, or checking with previous users about possible errors and changes seen to be made. It is also helpful to identify input and output for the program.

Creating user stories helps by gathering information on what users want and need corrected/updated. With these stories, it is easier to see the end user's perspecitve and see how it meets goals. 


   - How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

There are multiple ways to approach developing a program. The Waterfall method is one strategy. While it is not the best in terms of flexibility, it does have a very standard straightforward strategy. Another method to use is Agile. This method is far more flexible, allowing for programs to be made and updated mutiple times. Unfortunately, this can potentially push out deadlines. 


   - What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software is like a good team member in almost any other field. Understand the part you play in the process and keeping up with that part, helping the team stay on track. Communication with your team is crucial and it is important to have constructive feedback when interacting with the team.
